## About the IEEE Computer Society’s VGTC

The VGTC promotes research in computer graphics, visualization, visual analytics, virtual reality, and mixed and augmented reality, as well as the application of these topics to science, engineering, medicine, business, and the arts. 

The VGTC goals are to contribute to our members’ professional development and advancement, help advance the state-of-the-art in visualization and computer graphics, promote national agendas in visualization and computer graphics, and foster inter-disciplinary interaction in all of our activities.

Visual computing encompasses a wide field of research and practice in **visualization** and **computer graphics**, and each is represented by a special international VGTC conference – visual analytics (VAST), information visualization (InfoVis), scientific visualization (SciVis), virtual reality and 3D user interfaces (VR), augmented and mixed reality (ISMAR), visualization of large and big data (LDAV), visualization of biological data (BioVis), and mixed topics on visualization and computer graphics (PacificVis and EuroVis).
We invite you to [join our online community](https://www.ieee.org/membership-catalog/productdetail/showProductDetailPage.html?product=CMYVG731&N=4294925450+4294925448&tcType=Computer%20Society&searchResults=Y) and learn more about the VGTC and its activities.
