<b>Title</b> <br/>Visualization and viability: the future of visual analysis in an era of autonomous discovery
</p>

<p>
<b>Abstract</b><br/>
VIS 2024 marks twenty years since the formative workshops that led to the development of the visual analytics research agenda.  Over those two decades, the visualization field has continued to refine the role for human inquiry in the process of data-driven discovery.  Visualization and visual analytics are at another inflection point, as AI-driven methods and the emergence of autonomous science, engineering, and operations motivate further evolution in the blending of human and machine intelligence.  Realizing the impact of new visualization advances by deploying them at scale for real-world applications, especially in an era of autonomy, also requires visualization practitioners to work within a growing ecosystem of enabling digital infrastructure that includes large-scale data management, AI engineering, and continuum compute.   The lessons learned from a series of visualization system deployments provide insight into future directions for the research community as it enters another era of significant change.
