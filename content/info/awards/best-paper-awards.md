Best paper and honorable mention awards are selected by a dedicated committee of experienced community members. Both awards recognize outstanding work from the pool of accepted papers. Best paper committees use a variety of criteria to select the best paper including potential impact to the community, the importance of any results obtained, and technical challenges overcome.

## Full Papers

The Best Papers Committee for VIS 2023 Full papers consists of seven distinguished members: G. Elisabeta (Liz) Marai (chair), Rita Borgo, Stefan Bruckner, Steffen Koch, Kwan-Liu Ma, Jo Wood, and Xiaoru Yuan. The Papers Chairs would like to thank the Best Papers Committee for their work and to congratulate the awardees!

### Best Papers

**Affective Visualization Design: Leveraging the Emotional Impact of Data**
<br/>
Authors: Xingyu Lan, Yanqiu Wu, Nan Cao

Justification: "In an area that has only recently been recognised for its importance, this paper stands out in providing a comprehensive review and evaluation of emotionally affective visualization design. With its systematic structuring of 170 surveyed papers and designs, along with a nuanced discussion of affective design form and motivation, it provides an important contribution to the community. It moves us beyond a collection of disparate design examples by establishing a foundational design space and framework relating design technique, thematic genre and task. In doing so, it provides an important step for future work to evaluate and improve affective design in visualization."

**Fast Compressed Segmentation Volumes for Scientific Visualization**
<br/>
Authors: Max Piochowiak, Carsten Dachsbacher

Justification: "This paper presents a work that is very well motivated, designed, evaluated and demonstrated. The authors took domain specific knowledge about the properties of the data and used it to develop a novel way to represent the data as a hierarchical sequence of instructions to reconstruct the data, to achieve high compression ratios in a data layout that can be used for interactive, level-of-detail rendering. Such a creative re-framing of data representation may also be applicable beyond rendering."

**Swaying the Public? Impacts of Election Forecast Visualizations on Emotion, Trust, and Intention in the 2022 U.S. Midterms**
<br/>
Authors: Fumeng Yang, Mandi Cai, Chloe Rose Mortenson, Hoda Fakhari, Ayse Deniz Lokmanoglu, Jessica Hullman, Steven Franconeri, Nicholas Diakopoulos, Erik Nisbet, Matthew Kay

Justification: "This thought-provoking, engaging paper presents a longitudinal, large-scale, real-time study on the impact of uncertainty visualization of election forecasts in the U.S. 2022 midterms. The study is researched, planned and executed in an exemplary manner. The experimental results offer intriguing insights into the effects of these uncertainty visualizations on viewer emotions, trust, and intention to vote. Beyond the topical subject, the findings are useful to any uncertainty visualization endeavors."

**TimeSplines: Sketch-based Authoring of Flexible and Idiosyncratic Timelines**
<br/>
Authors: Anna Offenwanger, Matthew Brehmer, Fanny Chevalier, Theophanis Tsandilas

Justification: "This creative paper introduces an impressive novel authoring tool to support free-form sketching with data. Specifically, the paper follows a technically-strong approach to support visually communicating chronological narratives which do not follow a linear development. Overall, the work supports expressive and creative styles of visualization, pushing further the state of the art in free-form drawing of data visualizations."

**Visualization of Discontinuous Vector Field Topology**
<br/>
Authors: Egzon Miftari, Daniel Durstewitz, Filip Sadlo

Justification: "This well motivated and elegant paper successfully extends vector field topology to discontinuous but piecewise-continuous vector fields, by providing extraction techniques for Filippov systems and extending these systems with non-unique transport. This work enables visualizing and exploring the behaviors of complex flow with discontinuities, which is extremely important in many engineering and application fields."

**Vortex Lens: Interactive Vortex Core Line Extraction using Observed Line Integral Convolution**
<br/>
Authors: Peter Rautek, Xingdi Zhang, Bernhard Woschizka, Thomas Theussl, Markus Hadwiger

Justification: "This work presents a novel and creative contribution to the analysis of vortex structures in 2D unsteady flows. It proposes a new interactive approach that keeps the user in the loop during reference frame optimization, allowing for the rapid exploration of real-world flow data. The paper utilizes a clever iterative optimization scheme that can be executed asynchronously during user interaction, alleviating the need for any pre-computation, representing a clear advancement of the state of the art. By explicitly exploring the connection between the mathematical formulation and physical meaningfulness, the paper further contributes to the foundations of flow visualization."
