This year we are excited to feature *both* [traditional application spotlights](#spot1) and the [new application spotlight demos](). Please see the list of accepted spotlights below.

# <a name="spot1"></a>Visualization Research within the Department of Energy

### Organizers
Kristi Potter, Sr Visualization Scientist, Group Manager, National Renewable Energy Lab

### Overview
Visualization—the use of visual elements to explore data, form hypotheses, or convey conclusions—has been an integral part of the scientific process funded by DOE. Starting from an initial exploration of new data to illustrating outcomes to the general public, visualization is one of the most intuitive and powerful ways of communication. This is especially true in the team based, cross-discipline environment of the many cutting- edge, large-scale projects funded by the Department of Energy. The Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program in particular, has long supported visualization, a highly effective means of exploring data and communicating results. Intuitive visualizations represent a significant force multiplier, connecting scientists across domains, with their stakeholders, and ultimately to policy makers and the public writ large. 

The goal of this application spotlight is to highlight the visualization research sponsored by the US Department of Energy (DOE) by bringing in Margaret Lentz, a program manager from the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program. 

The format will include a 30-minute talk by Margaret discussing the mission and goals of DOE and highlighting current areas and opportunities in DOE ASCR’s Data Visualization portfolio for investigators at various career stages, including the early career research program, and student internships. Her talk will help participants better understand the DOE ASCR mission space and how visualization contributes to that mission. 

We will also hold a 30-minute panel, led by organizer Kristi Potter, consisting of scientists from the different types of DOE labs – National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), Office of Science (SC), and Energy - which will help provide the scope of DOE’s research reach, as well as provide lab-level perspectives and visualization research project highlights. Each panelist will be asked to give a 5-minute talk about their home lab and a description of a particular research project. We will then ask panelists to answer questions about their experiences at the lab and will design these questions to clarify what life as a career staff member is like as well as how they got to their particular lab. We will then open up the session for questions from the audience and time for networking.

### List of Demos
| Name of software | URL | Authors | Contact | Description | Papers |
| -----------------| --- | ------- | ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| AltGeoViz | https://accessible-map-420308.uw.r.appspot.com/ | Chu Li, Rock Yuren Pang, Ather Sharif, Arnavi Chheda-Kothary, Jeffrey Heer, Jon E. Froehlich | Geovisualizations are powerful tools for exploratory spatial analysis, enabling sighted users to discern patterns, trends, and relationships within geographic data. However, these visual tools have remained largely inaccessible to screen-reader users. We introduce AltGeoViz, a new interactive geovisualization approach that dynamically generates alt-text descriptions based on the user's current map view, providing voiceover summaries of spatial patterns and descriptive statistics. In a remote user study with five screen-reader users, we found that participants were able to interact with spatial data in previously infeasible ways, demonstrated a clear understanding of data summaries and their location context, and could synthesize spatial understandings of their explorations. Moreover, we identified key areas for improvement, such as the addition of spatial navigation controls and comparative analysis features. | - AltGeoViz: Facilitating Accessible Geovisualization |

Mosaic decouples data processing from specification logic: clients publish their data needs as declarative queries that are then managed and automatically optimized by a coordinator that proxies access to a scalable data store. In this demo, we demonstrate Mosaic’s expressiveness, extensibility, and interoperability through examples that compose diverse visualization, interaction, and optimization techniques.<br><br>Mosaic has the potential as an open platform that bridges visualization languages, scalable visualization, and interactive data systems more broadly and we are excited to discuss how you can build your next research project on or into Mosaic. | Mosaic: An Architecture for Scalable & Interoperable Data Views |
