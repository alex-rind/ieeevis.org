**IEEE VIS 2025 will now be fully virtual.**

This page provides information about the technical configuration for virtually presenting and attending IEEE VIS 2025. Presentations in a session will be live over a virtual Zoom Meeting. Viewing of sessions will occur via a live YouTube broadcast that can be found on each session’s page.

**In the week leading up to the conference, all event organizers, session chairs, and presenters will receive technical details about the session they are involved in.**


## Attendee Information
All sessions will be entirely virtual - the live broadcasts (and subsequent recordings) will be available on the conference web page. YouTube recordings will be unlisted until they can be processed. Closed captions will be available to attendees through each session’s YouTube broadcast. Closed captions are automatically generated.

### Q+A and Discussion
Question and Answer (Q+A) for each presentation or panel will occur remotely over Slido. Slido will appear alongside the live broadcast on each session’s page. The session chair or event organizers will be responsible for fielding questions during the Q+A portions of each session. All attendees can participate in the discussion through the conference’s Discord channel.

## Info for Presenters

Presentations will take place over a live Zoom Meeting - with presenters sharing their screen, camera, and audio over Zoom. A link to the Zoom Meeting will be emailed to you by tech@ieeevis.org or by the event organizers (for associated events, workshops, panels, and/or tutorials).

**Presenter Check-List:**
1. Ensure you have an adequate internet connection for your presentation: 7.5Mbps/5.0Mbps (up/down).
2. [Install Zoom Desktop](https://zoom.us/download) before your session.
3. Create and/or log in to your Zoom account (can be any school or personal account).
4. [Grant Zoom permissions for macOS](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0064868). Zoom needs permissions for “Camera”, “Microphone”, and “Screen and System Audio Recording.”
5. If presenting with system audio (i.e. you intend to play a video with sound during your presentation), be sure to [share computer audio when sharing your screen](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0063608#h_01GBXFBZ8GBD3Z3YV70YRETA7Y). 
6. Join the Zoom Webinar for your session 15 minutes prior to the start of the session.
7. Mute yourself and turn off the video while others are presenting.
8. Do not listen, or watch the YouTube live broadcast during your session - this will cause an audio feedback loop.


## Info for Associated Events, Workshops, Tutorials, and Panels
Sessions for these event types will all have virtual capabilities for presenters and attendees. **Please note that all presenters must register for the conference. The registration includes a video release form that is needed to be included in the conference sessions.**

All of the below virtual capabilities will be used by default. Event organizers should communicate to the Tech Chairs if any capabilities should not be used. These capabilities include: 
1. Virtual presenters can share screen, video, and audio as presenters over the Zoom Meeting. Event organizers will need to communicate who will be presenting to the A/V Student Volunteer in the Zoom Meeting.
2. Streaming of the entire Zoom meeting to a live YouTube broadcast. The YouTube stream will appear unlisted on the ieeevis.org page for the session. After the conference ends, an edited version of the recording will be made public.
3. Discord channel for discussion. The link will be on the session page.
4. Sli.do channel for Q+A. The link will be on the session page.

In the week before the conference, the Tech Chairs will send an email with the above technical details for their session (e.g. Zoom Meeting, Slido, Discord).

Breakout Rooms will not be supported by the provided Zoom Meeting. Organizers are welcome to share an external Zoom Meeting for Breakout Rooms via their session's Discord.

## Info for Full, Short & Invited TVCG/CGA Papers
**All paper presentations will occur remotely over a Zoom Meeting.** All presenters must join the Zoom Meeting 15 minutes before the start of their session to test screen, video, and audio sharing. Presenters will share their desired screen or window for the presentation. If your presentation includes audio, please be sure to [share computer audio when sharing your screen](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0063608#h_01GBXFBZ8GBD3Z3YV70YRETA7Y). The stream from the Zoom Webinar will include the presenter’s shared screen, audio, and video sources - all to be streamed over the YouTube broadcast.
