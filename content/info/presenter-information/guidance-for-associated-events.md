## Event Organizer Information

This page provides information to organizers of associated events, workshops, tutorials, application spotlights, and other events about how to provide information about the schedule of their event to the technical committee.
 
## Technical Support

This year’s conference will be hybrid: sessions are streamed online and we will have on-site speakers as well as remote speakers, on-site presentations and prerecorded talks. On-site and remote Q+A will happen over sli.do. All attendees will also be invited to Discord for informal discussions and exchanges. We envision to provide the following technical equipment and support:

* The video output of the presentation laptop can be projected into the room and streamed to YouTube. Audio can be captured as well via the headphone jack (mono only).
* One camera can capture the speaker in the room. For most associated events, however, this camera will be in a fixed position to reduce human labor.
* Microphones are available. On-site interactions (e.g., on-site Q+A) should be kept at a minimum, though, due to the complexities it entails to make this work across both attendance modes. Please consider alternatives such as the use of sli.do or Discord.
* Remote speakers can join the session via Zoom for Q+A or live presentations (audio will be mono only, on-site as well as on the stream). Please be aware that if remote speakers and/or content is projected into the room and streamed to YouTube, the video output of the presentation laptop cannot be used at the same time.
* We expect that most remote speakers have pre-recorded and uploaded their presentation, which will be then played back and streamed by the on-site tech team.
* Please note that the support of panels will be limited this year and should be discussed with Program and Tech beforehand.


## Building Blocks
To ensure a smooth experience for both attendance modes, all events have to be structured in a similar way using a predefined set of building blocks and this structure has to be communicated to Program and Tech. We plan to support the following building blocks:

* **In-person presentation**: On-site attendee talks (session host or speaker) and may also present slides using the presentation laptop. This should be the default for on-site paper presentations and keynotes.
* **In-person Q+A**: On-site host asks questions to the on-site speaker.
* **Virtual presentation (pre-recorded)**: A pre-recorded video will be played back and also streamed to YouTube. This should be the default for remote paper presentations.
* **Virtual presentation (live)**: Remote speaker connects via Zoom and presents a talk or keynote live with screensharing over Zoom. Please note that the output of the presentation laptop cannot be projected or streamed at the same time. This block should only be used for important keynotes and talks as it is more complex to set up and also has lots of potential for technical issues such as low video and audio quality.
* **Virtual Q+A**: On-site host asks questions to a remote speaker who connects via Zoom.
* **In-person other**: Similar to ‘in-person presentation’. There is one dedicated speaker at a time (on-site speakers only). The speakers may alternate, but be aware of the fixed camera position. The output of the presentation laptop can be projected and streamed, including audio support (mono only). For instance, the presentation laptop could share an interactive web application (e.g., drawing board or Discord) that attendees could join from one of their devices.
* **In-person panel**: All panelists are on-site. Panelist presentations streamed to remote attendees. Questions asked from in-person audience and via sli.do.  Please note the limited support of panels this year.
* **Hybrid panel**: Some remote panelists join on-site panelists via Zoom. Please be aware that either the Zoom content (remote panelists, shared screen) can be projected and streamed OR the output of the presentation laptop, but not both at the same time. Please note the limited support of panels this year. 

We recognize that this may restrict your planning and creative freedom compared to previous on-site only conferences. Due to the hybrid mode this year alongside limited financial and human resources, we need to compromise on the complexity of the events so that we can offer on-site and remote participants somewhat equivalent experiences of all sessions.

## Scheduling your Event
The Program and Tech Committee will reach out to the organizers of each event to collect information about the planned items and building blocks using a spreadsheet. [Here you can find an examples](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17-ZmTYsr4-Oc--Xc9EWzhZ2PEut8VB4183S4dVBRwlw/edit#gid=0) of how this template will be structured and which kind of information we will collect. Please use the appropriate tab depending on if you have a half day or full day event.  All times should be in 24-hour format in the US Central Daylight time zone (time zone of Oklahoma City), and formatted as HHMM (H: hour, M: minute).  

For each session in your event, we need a schedule that defines a sequence and duration of time slots in the session and what will occur in each time slot:

* Type of slot according to our building blocks (e.g., “In-person presentation”)
* Title of the presentation / slot
* List of contributors / speakers and whether they attend on-site or join via Zoom
    * For any virtual presentation, this list needs to include all presenters and their contact information (names and emails) to send out Zoom credentials
* Information about the content such as the paper UID (or filename) of pre-recorded talks. If a paper UID is provided (something like v-full-0001), then we can fill in some of the information automatically (e.g., list of authors). Please try to provide as much information as you can (columns H-M), particularly for presentations. In some cases (e.g., In-person other), most of these columns can be empty.
* Additional comments/notes if necessary

Please note that a typical paper presentation therefore comprises two slots: the actual presentation and Q+A.

Note that regular attendees of your event will either join on-site or view the embedded stream and use embedded chat using sli.do on the conference web pages. They will not have access to the Zoom room.

All recorded presentations will be submitted as discussed in the [Talk Guide for Contributors](/year/2022/info/presenter-information/talk-guide).
