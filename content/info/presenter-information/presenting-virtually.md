# Before Your Session

One to four days before your session you will receive an automated email
from our scheduling system containing information about the session. This
email will include the schedule, general information about how the sessions
will work, the Zoom link, and the sli.do link.
You will receive one such email for each session where you are a presenter,
chair, or organizer.
In each Zoom meeting there will be a technician managing the stream
and assisting with technicial issues during the session.

# Joining Your Session's Zoom Meeting

The Zoom meeting will begin 15 minutes before
the session starts to allow the contributors, chair, and technician to set up
and test everyone's audio and video set up. Make sure you are in a well-lit
and quiet room, and have your laptop plugged in.
The Zoom meeting information will be included in the automated
session information email.
**Please make sure your Zoom is updated to the latest version (5.8).**
After the audio/video check the technician will communicate with
you over Zoom's text chat, so have this open in the pop-out view mode.

After the A/V setup check you should disable your video unless you are
preparing to speak or speaking on the stream.

# During Your Session

If your session contains playback of pre-recorded videos
(e.g., paper presentations), the technician will play these back directly on Youtube.
The technican will switch between the pre-recorded videos and the live session.

## Do Not Watch Yourself on Youtube

Even with the ultra low latency stream
setting there are about 5 seconds of delay between the stream and Youtube. If you
are watching Youtube for feedback on when you are live or what is playing
on the stream, the delay will be disorienting and you will be late. When the technician's
countdown to going live for Q&A or introductions ends, **you are live!**
Having the Youtube stream playing in the background can also result in audio
feedback on the stream when you are talking.

## Live Q&A

About one minute before the presentation ends the technician
will stop screen-sharing to set up for the Q&A portion. At this time you
should turn your video on.
When your presentation video has ended the technician will switch the
stream to display the Zoom meeting to allow live responses to questions
from attendees.
Questions will be asked via sli.do.
The chair will monitor the sli.do and relay them to
the presenters.

## As the Session Chair

As the chair you will provide live introductions to each recorded talk
and ask the presenter question from sli.do, similar to the typical
chair role in an in-person conference. Each title slide for a session will
contain a QR code that will allow attendees to ask sli.do questions on their
mobile device. **Please point out this code and remind attendees to use sli.do
for their questions**  Sli.do questions will be sorted by most popular and will be
moderated by the technican. It is important you repeat each question
back over Zoom so that the presenter and other attendees can hear them.
Please also see our example video from 2020 below on chairing the session. The only differences this year are
the use of sli.do and the removal of youtube chat.

## The End of Your Session
There is a **hard cut-off** 10 minutes after
the session is scheduled to end to allow time to set up the next session,
so please keep to the session schedule.
Additional discussion after the session can be continued on Discord.

# Example Session Tutorials
Please watch the example session tutorials for 2020 below to see what to expect as
a presenter in the virtual conference.  The only differences between 2020 and this year are the inclusion
of sli.do questions and the removal of youtube chat.
