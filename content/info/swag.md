## We're excited to announce that IEEE VIS 2025 Merchandise is Now Available!

<b>The [shop](https://ieee-vis.printify.me/){:target="_blank"} offers IEEE VIS 2025 branded t-shirts, sweatshirts, blankets, swimsuits, and, yes, even flip-flops, which are all available for a limited time.</b> New items will be added, so be sure to check in frequently. This merchandise will <i>NOT</i> be sold at the conference, so you must order items ahead of time and have them shipped to you!

All proceeds benefit the conference activities. 

Community contributions are encouraged. If you have VIS 2025 artwork you would like to contribute, contact the conference [General Chairs](mailto:general_chair@ieeevis.org?subject=Swag Store).

### FAQ

**Q: How the heck does this work?**

<ul>Printify is a platform that connects independent print shops with sellers (the conference) and buyers (you) of merchandise. When you place an order it is routed to the independent print shop which custom prints and ships the order directly to you. The conference gets a percentage of the proceeds (~25%) and the rest go to Printify and the print shop.</ul>

**Q: These items won't ship to me in a reasonable amount of time or reasonable cost. Can I pick them up at the conference?**

<ul>Unfortunately, the conference organization does not have the capacity to manage this. We recommend reaching out to a US-based colleague and shipping to them.</ul>

**Q: Why won't these items be available at the conference?**

<ul>We don't have any sense of demand for preordering merchadise or the organizational capacity to manage such an operation this year.</ul>
