## Summary

* This document describes the keywords used by IEEE VIS since 2020 for the submission process
* Keywords are meant to support matching of papers to reviewers
* Authors should use keywords differently than in years before 2020:
    * Authors **should** check keywords to **indicate expertise** required to review their submitted paper.
    * They **should NOT** check all keywords necessary to describe the content of their submitted paper.
* Reviewers use the keywords to rate their expertise, as in the years before.


## Keyword Use

Keywords in the paper submission and review system (PCS) are meant to help match papers to the most appropriate reviewers. Without going into the technical detail, there is an algorithm that tries to suggest reviewers for papers based on the expertise reviewers provided for keywords and based on the keywords selected for each paper. Below we give advice on how keywords should be used by authors and reviewers to ensure the best matches.

### For authors

When submitting a paper in the submission system, the corresponding author will have to select keywords to describe the expertise required to review their paper. Note that this is a change from the keyword usage pre-2020 where authors were asked to describe the content of their paper. Instead, authors should imagine that the list of keywords is preceded by the following phrase:

*“A reviewer judging my work should have expertise related to…”*

Authors can choose **any number of keywords** to define required expertise. Keywords can also be combined to describe a specific required expertise (see examples below).

Authors can also provide **additional keywords** in using the available text fields. These additional keywords cannot be taken into account to recommend a paper automatically to potential reviewers with the selected expertise but they might be used during manual assignments and will be used to collect data for future iterations on the keyword set.

For junior authors we strongly suggest consulting with their advisor about the most appropriate keywords to choose.

### For reviewers

A reviewer should imagine preceding each keyword by the phrase:

 *“I have the following level of expertise related to…”*

and then **for each keyword** select an expertise rating among four options:

* **None:** I have not published on or read enough papers related to the keyword to feel comfortable giving advice as a reviewer.
* **Limited:** I have limited experience and knowledge related to the keyword. I can give some advice as a reviewer but not about specific details.
* **Competent:** I feel competent to give input as a reviewer on at least some topics covered by this keyword. I understand and can discuss topics related to this keyword.
* **Expert:** I am an expert in topics covered by this keyword. I can provide guidance, troubleshoot and answer questions related to this keyword or contexts where it is used.

Reviewers can also specify **additional expertise keywords** in provided text fields. These additional keywords cannot be taken into account by the paper-matching algorithm and, therefore, will not be used to automatically recommend papers to a reviewer but paper chairs and PC members might take them into account for manual assignments from papers to reviewers and they will be used to collect data on future iterations of the keyword set.
