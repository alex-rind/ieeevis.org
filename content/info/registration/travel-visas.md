If you are planning to attend VIS 2024 and may need a visa, we encourage you to visit the [U.S. visa policy website](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en.html) for information on visa procedures and applications. Please allow ample time for visa processing.



## Visa Letter Requests

Visa letter requests are handled through the [VIS 2024 registration system]({{ 'info/registration/conference-registration' | relative_url }}) when you register for the conference. **You must be fully registered for the conference before any letter can be issued.** 

The generated letter will contain the following:

* Registration confirmation number
* Full name including Salutation (Mr., Ms., Mrs.) in the order of Salutation, Given (First) Name, Family (Last) Name
* Email address, mailing address and affiliation (business or school)

If additional information (such as paper title and number, passport number, passport expiration date, date of birth, etc) is necessary,  you can enter this information when you register and it will be included in the letter. If you have questions or additional requirement, you may contact [visa-letters@ieeevis.org](mailto:visa-letters@ieeevis.org).
