As part of IEEE VIS's ongoing efforts to engage with our community, the IEEE VIS governance bodies are seeking feedback from the VIS community! 

Join us from *3:00PM* to *4:30PM* Eastern Wednesday, October 16th. See the VIS schedule for the appropriate virtual links.

Learn more about what the IEEE VIS governing bodies took on as priorities for VIS 2025 and come suggest priorities for the IEEE VIS governing bodies to address as we move towards VIS 2025. All members of the VIS community are welcome!

Questions from the community are welcome during the townhall. A larger update on various other committees can be found here.
